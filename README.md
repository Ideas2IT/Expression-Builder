Expression-Builder
==================


  Pretty much in every Enterprise application we build, we found ourselves needing a query/expression builder with a nice modern UI. Since we didn't find a good open source component for this, we decided to roll our own. 

  To make it reusable, we designed it so that it can be easily bolted on any DB or for that matter on entity model in any language.

  The schema/entity definitions are read as JSONs and the generated expression is also written as a JSON. 


## Built using:

 - Jquery v2.1.0
 - Bootstrap 3.3.0
 - css3
